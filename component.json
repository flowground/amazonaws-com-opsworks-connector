You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Stacks can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.</p> <ul> <li> <p>opsworks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.us-west-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com (API only; not available in the AWS console)</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Chef Versions</b> </p> <p>When you call <a>CreateStack</a>, <a>CloneStack</a>, or <a>UpdateStack</a> we recommend you use the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> parameter to specify the Chef version. The recommended and default value for Linux stacks is currently 12. Windows stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html\">Chef Versions</a>.</p> <note> <p>You can specify Chef 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for your Linux stack. We recommend migrating your existing Linux stacks to Chef 12 as soon as possible.</p> </note>",
